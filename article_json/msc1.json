{"content":"I just spent three days in Moscow and the city mesmerised me. It sure is not as classically beautiful as Saint Petersburg. But it is a city of paradox and I loved it.  <br> Architecture is neither European nor Asian. It is Russian. You can spot here and there elements of Italian, French or Asian architecture but the result is original and unique. <br> Same for the people. Moscow is a mosaic of races living together. An amazing mix of the antic Kievan Rus and the many khanats of Genghis Khan empire. <br> Yet the paradox I liked most is Russian attitude towards their recent history. While you can still visit Lenin tomb, Peter the great just got a monumental statue on the Moskova and I saw people worshiping icons of the Romanov -the last Russian dynasty- in Moscow cathedral.","date":"2016-05-19","latitude":"5944","longitude":"6000","title":"Moscow: the capital"}
