{"content":"Last year I bought one of the first watches built in Soviet Russia. The first factory opened in Moscow during the great patriotic war -WWII- and the watches were called \"Pobeda\" for victory.  They were designed for soldiers. <br> During the war, as the Wehrmacht came closer to Moscow, some industries shifted to the East. A watch factory opened near Kazan. <br> By luck, my train companions were the great daughter and the great great son of the factory first director. They were going to Kazan to bring documents from their ancestor to the local museum. <br> The young boy -only 15- spoke perfect French and understood English. His mother used to be an engineer working on Buran - the Soviet space shuttle. Yet with Perestroika, Buran was abandoned, the need for engineers dried up and she had to work at the counter in a bank. <br> A very interesting meeting !","date":"2016-05-19","latitude":"6210","longitude":"5950","title":"Train companions"}
