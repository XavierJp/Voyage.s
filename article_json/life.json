{"content":"Life in the train is simple. One could say it is minimalist. No shower, little space and dried food. 50 people in a coach that repeat day after day: eat, drink, sleep, wait. <br> Every station and every clock in the train use Moscow time when we actually live 5 hours ahead. Time is abstract here. Only two dates matter. The date you get in and the date you get out. <br> Train has its hierarchy: <br> -1st class : 2 beds per compartment. I have never been. <br> -2d class Koupe : 4 beds per compartment. I have tried it for two hours, it is cool. <br> -3rd class Platskart : open sleeping, open snoring ! 6 bed per compartment. And compartments are opened. Also called hard-sleeping as the mattress is really thin. <br> -4th class Obshi : open sitting - dont try that for 15h. <br>I travel mostly in Platskart. In my train, the further from the engine, the lower the class. It sounds a bit like Snowpiercer and a funny little Baboushka even told me : Frantsya? Koupe! Which mean I guess: You are French? You should be in upper class ! <br> Train is rather safe. But I keep documents and money in my pillow and I dont show my camera or my Gopro. <br> From Yekaterinburg to Krasnoyarsk temperatures were around 30° inside, with no AC. As we went closer to Baikal it got cooler - around 20/25°. <br> Once in the coach there is only one master on board. It is often a she and she does everything. As you arrived she rents you sheets for 130 RUB. You can then prepare your bed and put on your pyjamas. And after a short night she wakes you up: we arrive at destination !","date":"2016-05-24","latitude":"6564","longitude":"6449","title":"Life in Transsiberian"}
