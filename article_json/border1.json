{"content":"After 3000km of Siberia, the border area showed a beautiful succession of landscapes. Baikal mountains, desert and finally the green land of Ulaanbataar. <br> That part of the trip wasnt booked in advance. The international train was way too expensive (more than 100e) and on internet some people advised to do it on the cheap. <br> I took three different trains and paid 35e. It turned out that the international carriage was successively attached to every train I took. <br> At the border, customs got on the train. I didnt queue, they came to us. This was the smoothest border control I ever did! <br> On this train I met the foreigners of the international carriage. I understood why i didnt meet anybody in the train before. Foreigners use khupe -2nd class, 4 bed compartment- and I travelled in plaskart -3rd class, open compartment. <br> And finally on the last train I met cute little Poyna that draw me the fastest car Mongolia have ever seen. <br> Edit: Mongolia railway has the coolest logo: two running horses. If Russian trains always arrive on time Mongolian trains seem to arrive with style!","date":"2016-05-26","latitude":"7895","longitude":"6230","title":"Russia-Mongolia border"}
