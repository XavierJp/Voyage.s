{"content":"I could only stay one day there. As soon as I got off the train I rushed to Litsvianka. It is a little harbour on Baikal coast. There I enjoyed a relaxing hike with a view on the lake and the white summits of the opposit shore. During the hike, I joined two French guys and one Irish girl. They were the first foreigners I met in Russia and it was a pleasure to walk with them. After 2h we reached a small beach. The water was too cold for a bath but we drank it and it was surprisingly pure. <br> I then got back to my bus in Listvianka. I wander a little bit around Irkustk streets and by 10pm I was back on the train, on my way to Mongolian border.","date":"2016-05-25","latitude":"7895","longitude":"6530","title":"Irkustk and Baikal lake"}
