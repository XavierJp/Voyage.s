{"content":"I like train because it my favourite place to read books. During the last 100 hours of train (including six nights!) I had time to read a few books: <br> The Accursed king (Les rois Maudits) - Maurice Druon : George RR Martin main source of inspiration for its worldwide famous Game Of Throne. 7 amazing books -I started to read two years ago- that will make you love history. <br> Michel Strogoff from Moscow to Irkutsk - Jules Verne: THE book I had to read during this trip. Really nice story. Funny to see how cities and transportations have changed! A little too short. <br> When I was a Work of Art (Lorsque jetais une oeuvre dart) - Eric Emmanuel Schmidf: I found it flat. I guess I didnt understand. <br> The man in the high castle (Le ma√Ætre du haut chateau)- Phillip K Dick: Excellent! Fiction about an alternative future where imperial Japan and nazi Germany have won the war and are in the middle of cold war. <br> Metronome - Lorant Deutsh: tons of tiny details about Paris history told with metro station names. Interesting yet sometimes boring. <br> The man with the miracle hands (Les mains du miracle) - Joseph Kessel:  the true story of Himmler personal doctor and massagist. One could say a mix between Shindlers list and the Fall.","date":"2016-05-23","latitude":"6949","longitude":"6249","title":"Books"}
