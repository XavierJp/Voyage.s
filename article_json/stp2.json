{"content":"Aeroflot eventually brought me back my luggages after two days. <br> But this short episode forced me to talk to Russian people, looking for help. It turns out that Russians are the most helpful people. Once you established the contact -even if you dont have a word in common- they may stop everything they are doing just to help you ! <br> Once I got my luggages back I started to fully enjoyed the city and its beautiful European architecture. In Saint Petersburg, inhabitation buildings mix with elegance classical and baroque style.\nYet even more impressive are the dimmensions of the city. Buildings are not very high -three to four floors on average- but incredibly long! If typical Paris building was a square, Saint-Petersburg would be an horizontal rectangle and Hong-Kong a vertical one! <br> And the comparison does not stop here: all three cities are full of French and Chinese people! <br>  It is now time to go to Moscou. My first train trip. Twelve hours...on a seat!","date":"2016-05-15","latitude":"5841","longitude":"6683","title":"Saint-Petersburg: city of Tsars"}
