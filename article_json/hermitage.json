{"content":"With its magnificent interiors and end less corridors Hermitage deserves its own article. <br> Its classical and impressionist collections clearly lives up to their reputation. But what I enjoyed most is the unique atmosphere of the museum. <br> It is set in the Winter palace, the former residence of the tsars. It is a huge difference with the Louvre in France. Louvre as we know it was only completed in the middle of 19th century, long after its establishement in 1792. French leaders would rather live in the Tuileries palace. But in Hermitage, emperors lived and ruled the country and you feel it.","date":"2016-05-18","latitude":"5841","longitude":"6693","title":"Saint-Petsersbourg: the Hermitage"}
