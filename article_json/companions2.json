{"content":"This time nobody speaks French. And nobody speaks English either. At start, people are not very talkative. <br> Yet after a while some people try to talk to me. There is Alexander who wants a French souvenir -a magnet or something. I have nothing so I draw a small Eiffel tower for him. In exchange, he gives me a strange powder in silver wrapping. It is an energy drink I guess. It has a very chemical taste. Alexander is a 23 year old policeman in Iaroslav. His parents lives in Irkutsk. More than 4000km away! <br> There is also Ilhom -pronounce it Ilrom. He is Uzbek, from Tashkent. He is in his sixties and works as a bus driver in Russia. We show each other our passports and we compare country stamps. He gives me some sunflower seeds to eat and some tea. I would later use these seeds as an excellent icebreaker in Mongolian trains. <br> Everybody on board is really nice and helpful, especially old guys. When I told them I am french, I got a huge smile with something like : Frantsya? Bonjour! Paris ! Jacques Chirac!","date":"2016-05-24","latitude":"7100","longitude":"6049","title":"Train companions 2"}
