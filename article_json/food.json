{"content":"Russian cooking is meant for winter times. It is not light but it is warm and it tastes good. Georgian and Caucasian specialties are excellent. <br> The most common dish I ate in Russia is soups. Russians are excellent at soup making. Borsh is there most famous. It is a delicious mix of red onions with herbs and cream. <br> I also loved their mushroom Julienne, served in a strange, huge spoon. <br> In Kazan I tasted a delicious Turkish coffee, also served in very elegant dishes. It was accompanied with two little glasses: mint and water. <br> Russian are also very good with dumplings. They call it Pelmeni and stuffed them with meat. It probably came from Northern China through Mongol invasions. And it might be at the origin of Italian raviolis. <br> Bonus: i could not not try McDonalds. I love the McDonalds paradox. They embody taste standardisation across the world and you can buy the same Big Mac in Paris and Moscow, yet they feel the need to create country-specific burgers ! <br> Russian custom burger was ok. But Thailandese triple cheeseburger is still first in my heart.","date":"2016-05-23","latitude":"6464","longitude":"6349","title":"Russian food"}
