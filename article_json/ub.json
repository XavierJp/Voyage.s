{"content":"Lets be honest: Mongolia disappointed me a lot. I probably had too high expectations. I expected to find a Jack London-ish country, wild and empty. <br> It is actually a northern version of Thailand and tourists are the new cash cow. <br> I met many more english speaking people than in Russia. And they were all trying to sell me something ridiculously expensive. A single night in a yurt cost twice as much as what I paid in St Petersburg. Hire a driver for a day cost more than what I paid to cross the entire country by train. <br> Rather than paying for a 50e per day tour, I went to Terelj national park on my own. It took me 3 hours, 3 buses and 3e. One of the buses was a Korean van with 13 seats. By the time we arrived at destination we were 26 plus a baby! <br> Once in the park, I hiked for three days and tried to climb on every mountain I saw. I met goats, impressively big tics and roaming horses here and there. Very peaceful and relaxing.","date":"2016-05-28","latitude":"8000","longitude":"6230","title":"Ulaanbataar: Terelj national park"}
