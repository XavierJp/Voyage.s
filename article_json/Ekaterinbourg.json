{"content":"It is not the most beautiful city. 4th city by the size, it was founded 3 centuries ago and it became a big industrial center thanks to the rich mines of Ural. <br> However it has a huge symbolic value. First it is the place where the Romanov got murdered, on July 17th, 1918. Second it is the first city east of Ural mountains. My first step in Siberia! <br> Is it also a most needed break before a 50h train trip to Irkutsk. A 3000km trip and very likely no shower before Ulanbataar (5 days).","date":"2016-05-22","latitude":"6464","longitude":"6149","title":"Yekaterinburg : Ural border"}
