{"content":"Mongolia is even more broken than what I thought. On public holidays, the border is closed! <br> June 1st is children day. Thats how I got stuck in the middle of Gobi desert in Zamyn-Uud. Ouigar -a mongol I met on the train- welcomed me for a day. I soon met his 9 year old daughter: Mandorai. I guess Ouigar is unemployed and Mandorai mother left some money to buy some presents for children day. In the morning we went out to buy presents, and a cake for lunch. But then, as the day went on Ouigar started to drink and smoke all the money left. <br> Sharing ordinary Mongolian life ended up being one of the weirdest day of my life. By four he was so drank he couldnt wake up. There was an hotel nearby but I decided to stay. Mandorai tried to taught me how to play jacks -made with horse bones. We exchanged some drawing and plaid the game where you choose a country and have to find it on the map. I dont understand Mongolian but country names sounds the same. At night Mandorai mother came back and she started to fight with Ouigar. <br> On next day, I left this sad place on early morning and rushed to the border. <br> Border control was epic. I have never seen such a mess. On Mongolian side, everybody was pushing and yelling. On Chinese side it was surprisingly clean and neat. Such a relief to finally reach China. 4 hours later I was in the train. 15 more hours and I arrived in Beijing.","date":"2016-05-1","latitude":"8200","longitude":"6230","title":"Monglia-China border"}
