It was 6 Celsius (approximately 40 Fahrenheit) and I could barely remember the warm temperatures of Hong Kong. <br> I did stress a little bit at Russian border control but they accepted me in Russia. I got a few RUB and my printed train tickets till Irkutsk. I am now ready for departure. <br> I am ready for a 12 000 km journey on rails, with four main steps : <br> 1. Saint Petersburg - Moscow : 8 days of visit back into Russian recent history. <br> 12h of train | 800 km <br>2. Moscow - Irkutsk : the Russian part of the transmongolian railway. From the Moscow Kremlin to the Baikal lake. <br> 80h of train | only one timezone | 5185 km.<br> 3. Irkutsk - Beijing : the Mongolian steppe <br> 50h of train | 3 timezones | 2780 km. <br> 4. Beijing - Hong-Kong : back to China! <br> 30h of train | 3300 km.<br> When you think about it, 10 000 km is a lot in itself yet it is quite small compared to the 40 000 km of Earth perimeter ... <br><br>UPDATE: when I wrote this article I didnt know, but they lost my luggage with all my clothes at Moscow Airport. Lets see if they find it.<br>","date":"2016-05-13","latitude":"5841","longitude":"6683","title":"Saint-Petersburg : arrival"}
