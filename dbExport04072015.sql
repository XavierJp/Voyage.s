INSERT INTO `Articles` VALUES (32,'Saint-Petersburg: departure','2016-05-13 00:00:00','00:35 UTC+3 : After five sunny days in Montenegro, I just landed in Russia. It was 6 Celsius (approximately 40 Fahrenheit) and I could barely remember the warm temperatures of Hong Kong. <br> I did stress a little bit at Russian border control but they accepted me in Russia. I got a few RUB and my printed train tickets till Irkutsk. I am now ready for departure. <br> I am ready for a 12 000 km journey on rails, with four main steps : <br> 1. Saint Petersburg - Moscow : 8 days of visit back into Russian recent history. <br> 12h of train | 800 km <br>2. Moscow - Irkutsk : the Russian part of the transmongolian railway. From the Moscow Kremlin to the Baikal lake. <br> 80h of train | only one timezone | 5185 km.<br> 3. Irkutsk - Beijing : the Mongolian steppe <br> 50h of train | 3 timezones | 2780 km. <br> 4. Beijing - Hong-Kong : back to China! <br> 30h of train | 3300 km.<br> When you think about it, 10 000 km is a lot in itself yet it is quite small compared to the 40 000 km of Earth perimeter ... <br><br>UPDATE: when I wrote this article I didnt know, but they lost my luggage with all my clothes at Moscow Airport. Lets see if they find it.<br>','5800','6800'),(33,'Saint-Petersburg: the Hermitage','2016-05-18 00:00:00','With its magnificent interiors and end less corridors Hermitage deserves its own article. <br> Its classical and impressionist collections clearly lives up to their reputation. But what I enjoyed most is the unique atmosphere of the museum. <br> It is set in the Winter palace, the former residence of the tsars. It is a huge difference with the Louvre in France. Louvre as we know it was only completed in the middle of 19th century, long after its establishement in 1792. French leaders would rather live in the Tuileries palace. But in Hermitage, emperors lived and ruled the country and you feel it.','5880','6550'),(34,'Saint-Petersburg: city of Tsars','2016-05-15 00:00:00','Aeroflot eventually brought me back my luggages after two days. <br> But this short episode forced me to talk to Russian people, looking for help. It turns out that Russians are the most helpful people. Once you established the contact -even if you dont have a word in common- they may stop everything they are doing just to help you ! <br> Once I got my luggages back I started to fully enjoyed the city and its beautiful European architecture. In Saint Petersburg, inhabitation buildings mix with elegance classical and baroque style. <br> Yet even more impressive are the dimmensions of the city. Buildings are not very high -three to four floors on average- but incredibly long! If typical Paris building was a square, Saint-Petersburg would be an horizontal rectangle and Hong-Kong a vertical one! <br> And the comparison does not stop here: all three cities are full of French and Chinese people! <br>  It is now time to go to Moscou. My first train trip. Twelve hours...on a seat!','5840','6683'),(35,'Moscow: the capital','2016-05-19 00:00:00','I just spent three days in Moscow and the city mesmerised me. It sure is not as classically beautiful as Saint Petersburg. But it is a city of paradox and I loved it.  <br> Architecture is neither European nor Asian. It is Russian. You can spot here and there elements of Italian, French or Asian architecture but the result is original and unique. <br> Same for the people. Moscow is a mosaic of races living together. An amazing mix of the antic Kievan Rus and the many khanats of Genghis Khan empire. <br> Yet the paradox I liked most is Russian attitude towards their recent history. While you can still visit Lenin tomb, Peter the great just got a monumental statue on the Moskova and I saw people worshiping icons of the Romanov -the last Russian dynasty- in Moscow cathedral.','6010','6150'),(36,'Moscow: the metro','2016-05-19 00:00:00','Moscow metro is beautiful. It is the pride of its inhabitants. And somehow it illustrates the reconciliation that has been made between Imperial and Soviet past.','6044','6049'),(37,'Train companions','2016-05-19 00:00:00','Last year I bought one of the first watches built in Soviet Russia. The first factory opened in Moscow during the great patriotic war -WWII- and the watches were called Pobeda or victory.  They were designed for soldiers. <br> During the war, as the Wehrmacht came closer to Moscow, some industries shifted to the East. A watch factory opened near Kazan. <br> By luck, my train companions were the great daughter and the great great son of the factory first director. They were going to Kazan to bring documents from their ancestor to the local museum. <br> The young boy -only 15- spoke perfect French and understood English. His mother used to be an engineer working on Buran - the Soviet space shuttle. Yet with Perestroika, Buran was abandoned, the need for engineers dried up and she had to work at the counter in a bank. <br> A very interesting meeting !','6210','5950'),(38,'Kazan','2016-05-20 00:00:00','Capital of Tatarstan, Kazan seems to embody Russian multiethnicity as it is the capital of Muslims in Russia. <br> But what I enjoyed the most was the tiny museum of Soviet lifestyle. A huge collection of day life objects recreating an amazing atmosphere. <br> In Kazan I also got another example of Russian generosity. I had bought an extremely cheap ticket for a Bolshoi ballet in Kazan theatre, but there was a misunderstanding and they gave me ticket for the wrong date. The administrator -rather than simply reimbursing me- offered me a folding seat at five meter from the royal box. The best seat I could dreamed of !','6364','6049'),(41,'Russian food','2016-05-23 00:00:00','Russian cooking is meant for winter times. It is not light but it is warm and it tastes good. Georgian and Caucasian specialties are excellent. <br> The most common dish I ate in Russia is soups. Russians are excellent at soup making. Borsh is there most famous. It is a delicious mix of red onions with herbs and cream. <br> I also loved their mushroom Julienne, served in a strange, huge spoon. <br> In Kazan I tasted a delicious Turkish coffee, also served in very elegant dishes. It was accompanied with two little glasses: mint and water. <br> Russian are also very good with dumplings. They call it Pelmeni and stuffed them with meat. It probably came from Northern China through Mongol invasions. And it might be at the origin of Italian raviolis. <br> Bonus: i could not not try McDonalds. I love the McDonalds paradox. They embody taste standardisation across the world and you can buy the same Big Mac in Paris and Moscow, yet they feel the need to create country-specific burgers ! <br> Russian custom burger was ok. But Thailandese triple cheeseburger is still first in my heart.','6464','6149'),(42,'Yekaterinburg : Ural border','2016-05-22 00:00:00','It is not the most beautiful city. 4th city by the size, it was founded 3 centuries ago and it became a big industrial center thanks to the rich mines of Ural. <br> However it has a huge symbolic value. First it is the place where the Romanov got murdered, on July 17th, 1918. Second it is the first city east of Ural mountains. My first step in Siberia! <br> Is it also a most needed break before a 50h train trip to Irkutsk. A 3000km trip and very likely no shower before Ulanbataar (5 days).','6649','6249'),(43,'Life in Transsiberian','2016-05-24 00:00:00','Life in the train is simple. One could say it is minimalist. No shower, little space and dried food. 50 people in a coach that repeat day after day: eat, drink, sleep, wait. <br> Every station and every clock in the train use Moscow time when we actually live 5 hours ahead. Time is abstract here. Only two dates matter. The date you get in and the date you get out. <br> Train has its hierarchy: <br> -1st class : 2 beds per compartment. I have never been. <br> -2d class Koupe : 4 beds per compartment. I have tried it for two hours, it is cool. <br> -3rd class Platskart : open sleeping, open snoring ! 6 bed per compartment. And compartments are opened. Also called hard-sleeping as the mattress is really thin. <br> -4th class Obshi : open sitting - dont try that for 15h. <br>I travel mostly in Platskart. In my train, the further from the engine, the lower the class. It sounds a bit like Snowpiercer and a funny little Baboushka even told me : Frantsya? Koupe! Which mean I guess: You are French? You should be in upper class ! <br> Train is rather safe. But I keep documents and money in my pillow and I dont show my camera or my Gopro. <br> From Yekaterinburg to Krasnoyarsk temperatures were around 30 C inside, with no AC. As we went closer to Baikal it got cooler - around 20/25 C. <br> Once in the coach there is only one master on board. It is often a she and she does everything. As you arrived she rents you sheets for 130 RUB. You can then prepare your bed and put on your pyjamas. And after a short night she wakes you up: we arrive at destination !','7549','6049'),(44,'Books','2016-05-23 00:00:00','I like train because it my favourite place to read books. During the last 100 hours of train (including six nights!) I had time to read a few books: <br> The Accursed king (Les rois Maudits) - Maurice Druon : George RR Martin main source of inspiration for its worldwide famous Game Of Throne. 7 amazing books -I started to read two years ago- that will make you love history. <br> Michel Strogoff from Moscow to Irkutsk - Jules Verne: THE book I had to read during this trip. Really nice story. Funny to see how cities and transportations have changed! A little too short. <br> When I was a Work of Art (Lorsque jetais une oeuvre dart) - Eric Emmanuel Schmidt: I found it flat. I guess I didnt understand. <br> The man in the high castle (Le maitre du haut chateau)- Phillip K Dick: Excellent! Fiction about an alternative future where imperial Japan and nazi Germany have won the war and are in the middle of cold war. <br> Metronome - Lorant Deutsh: tons of tiny details about Paris history told with metro station names. Interesting yet sometimes boring. <br> The man with the miracle hands (Les mains du miracle) - Joseph Kessel:  the true story of Himmler personal doctor and massagistne could say a mix between Shindlers list and the Fall. I loved it.','6949','6249'),(45,'Watercolours','2016-05-25 00:00:00','Russian watercolours: <br> Church of the Savior on the blood - Saint Petersbourg. <br> Unknown official building - Yekaterinburg. <br> Baikal sight.','7650','6000'),(46,'Train companions 2','2016-05-24 00:00:00','This time nobody speaks French. And nobody speaks English either. At start, people are not very talkative. <br> Yet after a while some people try to talk to me. There is Alexander who wants a French souvenir -a magnet or something. I have nothing so I draw a small Eiffel tower for him. In exchange, he gives me a strange powder in silver wrapping. It is an energy drink I guess. It has a very chemical taste. Alexander is a 23 year old policeman in Iaroslav. His parents lives in Irkutsk. More than 4000km away! <br> There is also Ilhom -pronounce it Ilrom. He is Uzbek, from Tashkent. He is in his sixties and works as a bus driver in Russia. We show each other our passports and we compare country stamps. He gives me some sunflower seeds to eat and some tea. I would later use these seeds as an excellent icebreaker in Mongolian trains. <br> Everybody on board is really nice and helpful, especially old guys. When I told them I am french, I got a huge smile with something like : Frantsya? Bonjour! Paris ! Jacques Chirac!','7100','6049'),(47,'Irkustk and Baikal lake','2016-05-25 00:00:00','I could only stay one day there. As soon as I got off the train I rushed to Litsvianka. It is a little harbour on Baikal coast. <br> There I enjoyed a relaxing hike with a view on the lake and the white summits of the opposit shore. During the hike, I joined two French guys and one Irish girl. They were the first foreigners I met in Russia and it was a pleasure to walk with them. After 2h we reached a small beach. The water was too cold for a bath but we drank it and it was surprisingly pure. <br> I then got back to my bus in Listvianka. I wander a little bit around Irkustk streets and I found the exact same Lenin statue I had seen in Irkaterinburg. I wonder how many of these have been made. By 10pm I was back on the train, on my way to Mongolian border.','7895','6530'),(48,'Russia-Mongolia border','2016-05-26 00:00:00','After 3000km of Siberia, the border area showed a beautiful succession of landscapes. Baikal mountains, desert and finally the green land of Ulaanbataar. <br> That part of the trip wasnt booked in advance. The international train was way too expensive (more than 100e) and on internet some people advised to do it on the cheap. <br> I took three different trains and paid 35e. It turned out that the international carriage was successively attached to every train I took. <br> At the border, customs got on the train. I didnt queue, they came to us. This was the smoothest border control I ever did! <br> On this train I met the foreigners of the international carriage. I understood why i didnt meet anybody in the train before. Foreigners use khupe -2nd class, 4 bed compartment- and I travelled in plaskart -3rd class, open compartment. <br> And finally on the last train I met cute little Poyna that draw me the fastest car Mongolia have ever seen. <br> Edit: Mongolia railway has the coolest logo: two running horses. If Russian trains always arrive on time Mongolian trains seem to arrive with style!','7895','6230'),(49,'Ulaanbataar: Terelj national park','2016-05-28 00:00:00','Lets be honest: Mongolia disappointed me a lot. I probably had too high expectations. I expected to find a Jack London-ish country, wild and empty. <br> It is actually a northern version of Thailand and tourists are the new cash cow. <br> I met many more english speaking people than in Russia. And they were all trying to sell me something ridiculously expensive. A single night in a yurt cost twice as much as what I paid in St Petersburg. Hire a driver for a day cost more than what I paid to cross the entire country by train. <br> Rather than paying for a 50e per day tour, I went to Terelj national park on my own. It took me 3 hours, 3 buses and 3e. One of the buses was a Korean van with 13 seats. By the time we arrived at destination we were 26 plus a baby! <br> Once in the park, I hiked for three days and tried to climb on every mountain I saw. I met goats, impressively big tics and roaming horses here and there. Very peaceful and relaxing.','8000','6230'),(50,'Monglia-China border','2016-05-01 00:00:00','Mongolia is even more broken than what I thought. On public holidays, the border is closed! <br> June 1st is children day. Thats how I got stuck in the middle of Gobi desert in Zamyn-Uud. Ouigar -a mongol I met on the train- welcomed me for a day. I soon met his 9 year old daughter: Mandorai. I guess Ouigar is unemployed and Mandorai mother left some money to buy some presents for children day. In the morning we went out to buy presents, and a cake for lunch. But then, as the day went on Ouigar started to drink and smoke all the money left. <br> Sharing ordinary Mongolian life ended up being one of the weirdest day of my life. By four he was so drank he couldnt wake up. There was an hotel nearby but I decided to stay. Mandorai tried to taught me how to play jacks -made with horse bones. We exchanged some drawing and plaid the game where you choose a country and have to find it on the map. I dont understand Mongolian but country names sounds the same. At night Mandorai mother came back and she started to fight with Ouigar. <br> On next day, I left this sad place on early morning and rushed to the border. <br> Border control was epic. I have never seen such a mess. On Mongolian side, everybody was pushing and yelling. On Chinese side it was surprisingly clean and neat. Such a relief to finally reach China. 4 hours later I was in the train. 15 more hours and I arrived in Beijing.','8200','6230');
